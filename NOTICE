Vectrix Attribution Notice
==========================

Vectrix is an MIT-licensed rendering-first math library.

This codebase contains:

1) Work derived from JOML
-------------------------
Portions of the library are derived from, adapted from, or based on JOML
(Java OpenGL Math Library), also licensed under MIT.

Primary derived areas include:
- Core vector/matrix/quaternion primitives and related interfaces in `org.vectrix.core`
- Legacy/compatibility sampling components in `org.vectrix.sampling`
- Various geometry/intersection utilities and tests that retain JOML lineage

Original JOML copyright notices are preserved in file headers where applicable.

JOML project:

2) Original Vectrix work
------------------------
Substantial portions are original Vectrix implementations, including but not limited to:
- Curve framework (`org.vectrix.curve`)
- FFT and convolution (`org.vectrix.fft`)
- Optics/material math (`org.vectrix.optics`)
- Spherical harmonics (`org.vectrix.sh`)
- LTC evaluation (`org.vectrix.ltc`)
- Rendering math LUT builders (`org.vectrix.renderingmath`)
- GPU packing/compression utilities (`org.vectrix.gpu`)
- SoA and affine kernels (`org.vectrix.soa`, `org.vectrix.affine`)
- Hash, easing, SDF, and release-oriented infrastructure additions

3) Licensing
