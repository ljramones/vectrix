## [1.10.9] - 2026-02-22
### Added
- Quaternion rotation toolkit additions:
  - logarithm/exponential maps (`log`, `exp`)
  - SQUAD support (`squadControlPoint`, `squad`)
  - swing/twist decomposition
  - angular-velocity derive/integrate utilities
  - batch hemisphere normalization helpers
- Core math mode layering cleanup with `CoreConfig` and core-owned `MathMode` usage.
- Curve framework:
  - cubic Bezier/Hermite/Catmull-Rom/Uniform B-spline
  - scalar, vec2, vec3, vec4; float/double parity
  - first/second derivatives and SoA batch evaluation
  - arc-length table builders and evaluation mapping utilities
- Rendering/math subsystems:
  - color math and color-science utilities
  - easing functions
  - SDF primitive utilities
  - SH basis/projection/convolution (L2 + L3) with zero-allocation hot-path overloads
  - low-discrepancy sampling (Halton, Sobol, scrambled Sobol)
  - FFT + convolution support with complex types
  - optics package (`Ior*`, `Fresnel*`, thin-film, spectral helpers)
  - LUT builders for preintegrated SSS and atmospheric transmittance
  - interpolation utilities (bilinear + bicubic variants)
  - LTC helpers and bent-normal cone math
  - RK4 integration and range/remap helpers
- Package-level documentation (`package-info.java`) for new capability packages.
- New benchmark coverage for curves, SH, FFT, and optics.
- `BENCHMARKS.md` with reproducible methodology and baseline metrics.
- `NOTICE` file and license attribution updates for JOML-derived lineage.
- Capability reference document: `docs/vectrix-capabilities.md`.

### Changed
- `README.md` rewritten as a consumer-oriented guide with quick-start usage.
- `FrustumCullingBenchmark` updated to import `MathMode` from `org.vectrix.core`.
- Javadoc improvements on release-critical APIs (RK4 usage, quaternion interpolation contracts, SH projection and LTC contracts).

### Fixed
- Dual-quaternion blending antipodality regression coverage was added in tests.
- Various edge-case protections and STRICT-mode validation tests for quaternion and interpolation additions.

## [1.10.8] - Previous
### Note
- See git history before `1.10.9` for prior baseline work.
