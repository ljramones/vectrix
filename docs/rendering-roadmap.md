# Rendering Roadmap (Historical)

This document is retained as historical context.

The milestone plan previously tracked here has been completed and superseded by:
- `docs/vectrix-capabilities.md` for current feature inventory
- `BENCHMARKS.md` for current benchmark coverage and normalized per-op performance
- `docs/release-cut-checklist.md` for release process

## Current State
Vectrix now includes the originally planned rendering-first math scope, including:
- rotation/interpolation suite
- curves and arc-length mapping
- SH, FFT/convolution, optics/thin-film, LTC, SDF, color/science
- sampling (including scrambled Sobol), SoA skinning, and benchmark coverage

For new work planning, create a dedicated roadmap tied to concrete release targets rather than continuing this legacy milestone file.
